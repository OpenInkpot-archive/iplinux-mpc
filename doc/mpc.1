.SH "NAME"
mpc \- Program for controlling Music Player Daemon (MPD)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
mpc [<command> <arguments>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
mpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.  mpc connects to a MPD and
controls it according to commands and arguments passed to it.  If no arguments
are passed, current status is given.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI --format
.br
Configure the format of song display for status and the playlist.  The metadata delimiters are "%name%", "%artist%", "%album%", "%title%", "%track%", "%time%", and "%file%".  The [] operator is used to group output such that if no metadata delimiters are found or matched between '[' and ']', then none of the characters between '[' and ']' are output.  '&' and '|' are logical operators for and and or.  '#' is used to escape characters.  Some useful examples for format are: "%file%" and "[[%artist% - ]%title%]|[%file%]".
This command also takes the following defined escape sequences:
.br
\\\\ - backslash
.br
\\a - alert
.br
\\b - backspace
.br
\\t - tab
.br
\\n - newline
.br
\\v - vertical tab
.br
\\f - form-feed
.br
\\r - carriage return

the commands.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
This section describes some environment variables that affect how mpc operates.
.PP
MPD_HOST, MPD_PORT
.RS 3n
By default, mpc connects to localhost:6600.  This can be changed
either at compile-time, or by exporting the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT
environment variables.
.br
If you specify an absolute path in MPD_HOST, mpc attempts a connection
via Unix Domain Socket.
.br
To use a password with MPD, set MPD_HOST to password@host.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
.br
For useful examples of mpc use in playlist parsing, see mpd-m3u-playlist.sh and mpd-pls-playlist.sh.
.br
.SH "BUGS"
Report bugs on http://www.musicpd.org/mantis/
.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, mpc needs to convert characters to the
charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors when you're running mpc you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting any of the LC_CTYPE, LANG or LC_ALL environment variables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).
